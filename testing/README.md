# Automated Testing

This section contains the definition files for running dynamic testing using the `Dynamic Assessment & Regression Toolkit`
which provides the ability to run a suite of live tests against the software to ensure that everything is working as
expected. This is more of a system or end-to-end testing feature and is intended to bolster not replace unit tests.
